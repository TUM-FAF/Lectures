## Long Story Short

I think that **V**ersion **C**ontrol **S**ystem is if not "The most important" for sure one of the most important tools in development. There are a lot of VCS tool but the one that I learned and used my entire dev carrier is [GIT](https://git-scm.com/).  After 2-3 years of using, I still have to learn more about it. VCS and GIT are used to share work with other devs, so it's mandatory if you will work in teams (at university/at work/open-source). The tool that I use to store all my projects is https://github.com. I created a repo where you can learn how to do your [first contribution](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/faf-contributions) to a project. If you want to learn more about GIT and GitHub, you can find tones of tutorial online, but if you want to go more advanced I would suggest reading [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).


P.S. if you read this please give a sign, for me to know if this repo is used :blush:
