## Long Story Short

Let me start with a pretty bold statement: 
You can find pretty much anything on the Internet. 
But there's a catch: 
It's not always in one place. 
The data you need can be located in different sources and different websites, scattered on pages or available for download in one file. 
How to collect this data efficiently?

You could hire a team of highly trained copy-pasting monkeys (they need bananas..) or
you could write a small script in Python, using a [framework](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html) which makes automatic web scraping a breeze.

In this repository you can find the [slides](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/Lectures/blob/master/lecture%2317/Slides.pdf) used for this lecture (useful links on the last slide),
as well as a small project that we used to scrape the whole [menu](https://www.andys.md/en/pages/menu/) of Andy's Pizza restaurant.
It took us less than 2 minutes :smile:
